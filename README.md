# Advent of Code 2020
My Scala Solution to [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com). <br>
<br>
The challenge is about solving algorithmic problems for a given input and submitting the solution as fast as possible. 
Although I took care of good coding practice and efficiency keep in mind that the primary goal is to develope any workable solution as fast as possible.
Each day for 25 days a new problem gets unlocked. Each problem
is divided into 2 subproblems. The second subproblem becomes available when you submit your solution to the first subproblem. 
Unfortunetly, I started working on AoC 2020 when it already started :(

## Repository Structure 
[Here](https://github.com/alanmazankiewicz/advent_of_code_2020/tree/master/src/main/scala) you can find the relevent source code. For each day / problem there is one directory containing the code, 
test input and final input for the problem. Usually, the code for both subproblems is kept in one file. For some problems it was faster and easier to seperate 
both subproblems though.
